    "* In first summary, we can see that we get a high vector similarity.  However, we are unable to capture the fact that the two sentences in the summary are exactly identical, which is very bad.  We see this reflected with a low redundancy score by the human annotator. The high edit score comes from the entire second sentence being removed, as it is nearly identical to the first.\n",
    "* In the second summary, we see that the first sentence is very good.  However, the second sentence is both redundant and grammatically incorrect, randomly containing the word gazelle in a summary that should be about same-sex weddings.  In this case, it looks very difficult to accurately evaluate the overall value for the summary as well as grammar.  The second sentence is quite bad, and so does that mean that the entire summary should receive a score for overall and grammar that is bad?  Or should it be average because the first sentence is good?  It seems like it would be useful to have a metric here that reports whether the article contains fabrications or entirely irrelevant content.  Overall, this shows that high similarity can tell you that we have a summary with some relevant words and phrases, but does not guarantee that it will be cohesive or grammatically correct.\n",
    "* Third summary:  first sentence contains a phrase in  the beginning that does not make sense and is questionable for being grammatically correct.  The second sentence is nearly the same and is redundant.  However, we see that the human annotator gives a redundancy score of 2 on a 1-3 scale, and the same for grammar.  This is a bit confusing, because it is clearly very redundant.  \n",
    "* Fourth Summary:  The first sentence is mostly coherent and correct, with a phrase at the end that is nonsense.  The latter 2 sentences are quite bad.  They are nonsensical and grammatically incorrect.  This shows yet again that just because the words and phrases contained in a summary may have similar meaning individually, vector similarity fails to truly capture meaning and a measure of grammatical correctness.\n",
