    "* First summary: This summary is great, and is well represented by the evaluation metrics.  The only problem is a missing quotation mark that the annotator corrects.  This shows a stark contrast from the high similarity high edit human scores.  This requires only 1 small grammar change but still is given a 2 for grammar.  It seems like there were summaries that were far worse grammatically than this one that also received a 2.\n",
    "* Second summary: It is certainly not awful, but contains some spots where it seems like edits should have been made.  This shows again that VecSim misses grammaticality.\n",
    "* Third Summary: the metrics correctly indicate a good summary and there is no edit required\n",
    "* Fourth Summary:  The first sentence is good but then the second has a quite bad grammatical error.  I think redundancy should have been given a better score, just to note.  The metrics of VecSim and Edit dist would indicate this is a good summary, however, the grammar error in the second sentence is quite bad and a good metric should be penalized for this.\n",

    "It is hard for a human evaluate a summary using scales for various features, so I think the edit value is a step in the right direction in removing the sense of arbitrariness that we get when we are using the 1-3 scale like they are here.  Additionally, I think we can benefit from understanding what actually has been removed from a summary, whether it be redundant info or fixes of grammar.  In the latter case, we can see that a small change edit distance wise can fix a sentence, but it may be a quite bad error even if it is small."
